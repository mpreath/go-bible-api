# Mission
Our mission is to provide an open platform for accessing and searching public domain Bible translations that any organization or person can freely deploy and use within their own applications and solutions.  We have a production-level deployment of the architecture, funded by charitable giving, available for public use. For larger scale needs its recommended that organizations deploy their own instance.

# Overview
Coming soon.

# Architecture
- Go
- Gorilla mux for routing endpoints
- Postgres
- MongoDB

# Bible Translations
We support and have easy to deploy content for most public domain bible translations.  As translations become public domain we'll look to add them into the supported set of translations.
